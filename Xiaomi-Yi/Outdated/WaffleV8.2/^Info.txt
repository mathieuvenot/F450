Day is optimised for day time use and up to late sunset. After that it will become more grainy.

Night is for people who want to use the script at night or under indoor lighting.
It will work in daytime too, just slightly blurrier than the daytime one.
I have not included superview on night so you can use 30fps modes (better for night time)
